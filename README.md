Self-taught fullstack developer here!
I build things the right way from the ground up. My background in International Business taught me to think like a user, while my Cybersecurity studies made me obsessed with security.
I focus on both Android and web development, and I love bringing ideas to life through clean code, aesthetic design, and smooth user experiences. Whether I'm working with Kotlin and Firebase on mobile apps or employing Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for web projects, I always aim to develop apps that are modern, responsive, fast, and easy to maintain. I care about the little details, enjoy solving challenging bugs, and love turning creative concepts into real, functional tools that people actually want to use.
