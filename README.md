I'm a passionate and self-taught developer with a background in International Business and additional studies in Cybersecurity, which gives me a unique edge when it comes to building secure and scalable digital products. I focus on both Android and web development, and I love bringing ideas to life through clean code, aesthetic design, and smooth user experiences. Whether I'm working with Kotlin and Firebase on mobile apps or employing Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for web projects, I always aim to develop apps that are modern, responsive, and easy to maintain. I care about the little details, enjoy solving challenging bugs, and love turning creative concepts into real, functional tools that people actually want to use.
